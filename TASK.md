## Assignment

You should assume that this is a feature you are working on that will end up in our product.

Create an application that simulates an inference server. The application should display a video stream that can be started & stopped to simulate a camera that is running. Via another
button the user should be able to capture the current frame. When the user stops the camera stream, all the captured frames should be displayed as thumbnails with the possibility to open them for further investigation. Additionally, the timestamps of the capture should also be visible. We should also be able to add some tags to the thumbnails. Before being able to start the video stream, the user should first create a project. Any project that was created previously should also be visible, can be opened and deleted.
